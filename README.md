# PB_Wulff
The PB_Wulff package constructs the Wulff shapes of Al-Al3Ni phase boundaries based on Euler angles measured by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). It integrates Atomsk ("Atomsk: A tool for manipulating and converting atomic data files"
Pierre Hirel, Comput. Phys. Comm. 197 (2015) 212-219) for constructing bicrystal structures containing phase boundaries, and LAMMPS for performing atomistic simulations to determine grain boundary energy. The code for Wulff shape construction is built upon the implementation by termistotel: https://github.com/termistotel/Wulff-constructions. Some of the created structure files for bicrystals have wrong labels for the atoms, so post-processing adjustments are needed.

**Files:**

*create_angle.py*: generates the input files for constructing the phase boundary structures covering the full circle of inclination angles (0-360 ÌŠ ) for the defined misorientation

*atomsk.sh*: utilizes the Atomsk software to generate the phase boundary structures, based on the input files generated by create_angle.py

*phase.in*: the input script for performing phase boundary energy calculation in LAMMPS

*wulff.py*: extracts the computed ground state phase energies for the different inclination angles, and perform Wulff construction to obtain the Wulff shape

*Mishin-Ni-Al-2009.eam.alloy*: interatomic potential for multicomponent system containing Al and Ni, used for LAMMPS simulations

*NiAl3-ortho.xsf*: structure file for the Al3Ni crystal lattice

*search.py*: searches for the files that contain errors

*data.py*: makes adjustments to the intermediate files that contain errors

*adjust.sh*: makes adjustments to the final bicrystal structures that contain errors
